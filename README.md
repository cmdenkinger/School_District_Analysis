# School_District_Analysis
- PyCitySchools using Pandas
## Overview
The school board informed Maria and her supervisor of dishonesty regarding test scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. Maria has asked that the data for Thomas High School 9th graders be replaced with NaNs and keep the rest of the data intact. She wants this done so the state-standardized-testing results are not misleading.

The math and reading scores were replaced with NaN (Not a Number) for 461 student records, the ninth grade class.
## School District Summary
The school district has 15 total high schools, with about an even split between district and charter schools.
